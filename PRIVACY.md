## ðŸ“„ Journal Export

We provide an optional feature that allows you to export your journal entries as .txt files in a .zip archive.

This feature is designed to give you full ownership of your data, without compromising your privacy.

All export files are generated directly in your browser.

No data is uploaded, sent, or shared during the process.
